## Helpful functions, classes and expressions used in almost every project I built: 
• Call and run macros from another workbook using a sub routine from the current workbook <br/>
• Change the security mode and enable macros in order to prevent the security pop-up when opening another Excel workbook <br/>
• Call a second sub routine using VBS while the first routine is paused (waiting for an input, file dialog screen, etc.) <br/>
• Refresh a Power Query connection and pause the code until all the data has been retrieved <br/>
• Finding whether a string is in an array or not - binary result <br/>
• Waiting for an HTML element to be loaded before trying to access it. This is a much efficient solution than hard coding an arbitrary number or seconds to wait, or simply using **browser.Busy** or **browser.readyState <> 4** <br/>
• A class that creates a back up of the workbook before starting the macro <br/>
• A class that sends an email once an error is encountered, with the error description, number and error source. <br/>
• etc.
